#' @details
#' The SPEAR index is based on binary classification of species (or other taxonomic categories) into 'species at risk' and 'species not at risk' according to the following biological traits: 
#' \itemize{
#' \item physiological sensitivity to organic toxicant
#' \item generation time
#' \item presence of aquatic stages in water during the maximum pesticide usage period
#' \item migration abilities. 
#' }
#' A taxon is classified as a 'SPEcies At Risk' only if it has: (i) Sorganic value >-0.36, (ii) generation time >= 0.5 year, aquatic stages (eggs, larvae, pupae) during the periods of intensive pesticide usage, and (iv) low migration abilities. 
#' 
#' The SPEARpesticides index is computed as relative abundance of these taxa for each site and date as follows:
#' 
#' \deqn{SPEAR = \sum log10(x[i] + 1) * y / \sum log10(x[i] + 1)}
#' 
#' where x[i] is the abundance of the taxon i and y is 1 if taxon i is classified as 'at risk', otherwise 0. 
#' 
#' For further details about SPEARpesticides index see References.

#' @return A list of two data.frames:
#' \item{spear}{SPEARvalues per group}
#' \item{traits}{Trait table for each Taxon}
